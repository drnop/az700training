# Inserting Cisco Secure Firewall FTD in Azure with GWLB

## Introduction

This lab shows how to use service chaining with an Azure Gateway Load balancer in Azure to protect a web site.

You will need access to an azure subscription and the rights to create necessary objects in a resource group.

Prerequisite knowledge includes
* some understanding of Azure Networking (VNETs, subnets, routing, load balancers...)
* some understanding of Cisco Secure Firewall (FTD) managed  by Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC)
* some understanding of Azure CLI

The topology is shown in figure below.

All resources shown in azure should be  created in the student's Azure resource group. At a high level we note that we have two different VNETs.
* SERVERVNET where we define the public load balancer that distributes the traffic between Azure VMs VM1 and VM2 in the default subnet. We also have a public IP associated with the public load balancer so we can test the connection.
* FWVNET where we will define the Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) that will load balance traffic over the firewalls that will add services such as access rules with IPS, Anti-Malware, Reputation filtering and more.

The student accesses all the lab with an internet routable internet (student public IP).
